            <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: November 16, 2025</p>

            <p>Welcome to Peak Performance Auto. By accessing or using our website and services, you agree to be bound
                by these Terms of Service. Please read them carefully.</p>

            <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
            <p>By using our website, making a vehicle reservation, or scheduling a service appointment, you agree to
                these Terms of Service and our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, please do not use our services.</p>

            <h2>2. Vehicle Reservations</h2>
            <h3>2.1 Deposit Requirements</h3>
            <p>To reserve a vehicle, you must pay a non-refundable deposit as specified on the vehicle listing. The
                deposit amount is applied toward the final purchase price of the vehicle.</p>

            <h3>2.2 Reservation Process</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Reservations are made by clicking "Reserve This Car" and completing the payment process through
                    Stripe</li>
                <li>Upon successful payment, you will receive a confirmation email with your reservation details</li>
                <li>A reservation does not constitute a binding purchase agreement until a final sales contract is
                    signed</li>
                <li>Reserved vehicles are marked as "Reserved" on our website and are no longer available to other
                    customers</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2.3 Vehicle Inspection and Final Purchase</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>After placing a reservation, we will contact you within 2-3 business days to schedule an in-person
                    vehicle inspection</li>
                <li>You have the right to inspect the vehicle thoroughly before finalizing the purchase</li>
                <li>If you decide not to proceed after inspection, your deposit is non-refundable</li>
                <li>Final purchase is subject to execution of a sales agreement and payment of the remaining balance
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Deposit Refund Policy</h2>

                <li>The vehicle description or condition materially differs from what was advertised</li>
                <li>Peak Performance Auto is unable to deliver the vehicle as agreed</li>
            </ul>
